# Architecture Documentation

This document describes the technical architecture of the NeuroWealth Vault contract, including storage layout, data structures, and integration patterns.

## Overview

The NeuroWealth Vault is a Soroban smart contract that implements a non-custodial yield vault on the Stellar blockchain. Users deposit USDC, and an AI agent automatically deploys those funds across various yield-generating protocols.

## Storage Layout

### Instance Storage

Instance storage is used for contract-wide configuration that is read frequently but changes infrequently.

## Persistent Storage TTL Policy

Soroban persistent entries require rent (TTL). Expired `Shares` entries can be
archived and must be restored before use.

### Read-only getters (no TTL writes)

`get_balance` and `get_shares` only read storage. They do **not** call
`extend_ttl`, so RPC/indexer polling does not pay write costs or mutate ledger
state during simulation.

Implications for indexers and dashboards:

- High-frequency balance polling is safe and side-effect free.
- TTL for inactive users is **not** refreshed by read-only getters.
- Use `touch_user_ttl(user)` in a scheduled maintenance transaction when a user
  still has (or had) shares and you need to extend the `Shares` entry TTL without
  depositing or withdrawing.

### Explicit TTL maintenance

`touch_user_ttl(user)` extends the `Shares(user)` persistent entry when it
exists, using threshold **100** ledgers and extend-to **100** ledgers (same
parameters previously applied inside the read getters).

Returns `false` when no `Shares` entry exists (never deposited, or entry already
expired and removed).

### State-changing paths

`deposit`, `withdraw`, and `withdraw_all` update `Shares(user)` via `set`, which
refreshes TTL as part of normal writes. Routine user activity keeps share data
alive without calling `touch_user_ttl`.

## DataKey Structure

```rust
pub enum DataKey {
    Balance(Address),      // user -> usdc principal

    Deployer,             // deployer address (init only)
}
```

## Share Accounting Model

The vault uses a share-based accounting model compatible with the ERC-4626 standard. Each depositor receives vault shares proportional to their contribution at the time of deposit. As yield accrues and `TotalAssets` grows relative to `TotalShares`, each share appreciates in value — meaning later redeemers receive more USDC per share than they originally paid.

### Share Pricing

```
exchange_rate = TotalAssets / TotalShares          (assets per share)

shares_minted = (deposit_amount × TotalShares) / TotalAssets
assets_out    = (shares_burned × TotalAssets)  / TotalShares
```

The on-chain getter `get_exchange_rate()` returns `TotalAssets × 10_000_000 / TotalShares` (7-decimal fixed-point) to avoid fractional values.

### Overflow Safety

All share↔asset conversions use checked arithmetic:

```rust
// assets → shares (deposit, floor division)
shares = (assets * total_shares) / total_assets   // checked_mul

// shares → assets (withdraw, floor division)  
assets = (shares * total_assets) / total_shares   // checked_mul

// exchange rate (7-decimal fixed point)
rate = (total_assets * 10_000_000) / total_shares // checked_mul
```

**Maximum safe input before overflow depends on the current totals:**

- For `convert_to_shares`: `assets` must be ≤ `i128::MAX / total_shares` to avoid overflow in the `assets * total_shares` product. With a 100M USDC TVL cap and typical share counts, the practical deposit limit is far below this boundary, but the checked multiply ensures safety regardless of future configuration changes.
- For `convert_to_assets`: `shares` must be ≤ `i128::MAX / total_assets` to avoid overflow in the `shares * total_assets` product.

Current defaults (100M TVL cap) keep both products safely under `i128::MAX` for all realistic inputs. The checked operations ensure the contract reverts with an explicit error rather than silently wrapping if a configuration or environment change ever pushes these boundaries.

Tests in `tests/test_checked_arithmetic.rs` verify the overflow guard at `i128::MAX`.

### Yield Accrual via update_total_assets

The AI agent calls `update_total_assets(new_total)` to report yield earned in external protocols (e.g. Blend). This increases `TotalAssets` without changing `TotalShares`, which raises the share price for all holders. The update is bounded: a single call cannot decrease `TotalAssets` below the current value, and cannot increase it beyond a configurable maximum basis-point delta, preventing the agent from inflating balances arbitrarily.

### Blend Deployment

When the agent calls `rebalance(protocol="blend", ...)` the vault:

1. Approves the Blend pool to pull vault USDC (short-lived TTL approval stored in the shared `ApprovalTtl` key).
2. Calls `blend_pool.submit_with_allowance()` to supply USDC as a lender.
3. Records `CurrentProtocol = "blend"`.

On withdrawal, if the vault's idle balance is insufficient, it calls `blend_pool.submit()` to withdraw the required amount before transferring to the user.

### Approval TTL Management (#57)

Every `rebalance` and `harvest` call issues (or renews) a Stellar token approval
granting the Blend or DEX pool contract the right to pull USDC from the vault.

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Default TTL** | **100,000 ledgers** | ≈ 5.7 days at ~5 s/ledger on Stellar mainnet. Written as `DEFAULT_APPROVAL_TTL` in `lib.rs`. |
| Minimum TTL | 1,000 ledgers | `set_approval_ttl` rejects anything below this. |
| Maximum TTL | 500,000 ledgers | `set_approval_ttl` rejects anything above this. |
| **Near-expiry renewal threshold** | **1,000 ledgers** | Written as `APPROVAL_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD`. |

**Near-expiry renewal logic:**  
Before executing any protocol call, `rebalance` and `harvest` check whether the
stored approval expiry (`DataKey::BlendApprovalExpiry` / `DataKey::DexApprovalExpiry`)
is within `APPROVAL_RENEWAL_THRESHOLD` (1,000) ledgers of the current ledger sequence.
If so, the approval is refreshed to a full `ApprovalTtl` window before the protocol
interaction proceeds. This prevents approval-expiry reverts when many ledgers elapse
between agent calls.

`supply_to_blend` and `supply_to_dex` always issue a fresh approval for the exact
supply amount when they execute, and record the resulting expiry ledger in instance
storage for the renewal guard to read on the next call.

**Configuration:**  
- `set_approval_ttl(ttl)` — owner sets TTL (bounds: 1,000–500,000 ledgers). Emits `ApprovalTtlUpdatedEvent`.  
- `get_approval_ttl()` — returns configured TTL or `DEFAULT_APPROVAL_TTL` (100,000) when unset.  
- The legacy `set_blend_approval_ttl` / `get_blend_approval_ttl` setters write the same `ApprovalTtl` storage key and share the same audit trail.

### Historical: Phase 1 (1:1 accounting — deprecated)

Prior to the ERC-4626 model, the vault used simple 1:1 balance accounting: 1 deposited USDC = 1 vault balance unit, with no share concept. This approach could not track proportional yield and has been fully replaced. The `Balance(Address)` key is retained only for legacy migration paths and is no longer the authoritative ownership record — `Shares(Address)` is.

### Current Implementation (Share-Based)

The vault converts between USDC assets and vault shares using the current exchange rate:

```
shares = (assets * total_shares) / total_assets
assets = (shares * total_assets) / total_shares
```

**Key Features**:
- **Proportional Yield**: Users benefit from yield accrual as the `TotalAssets` increases relative to `TotalShares`.
- **Atomic Conversions**: Deposits mint shares and withdrawals burn shares based on the real-time asset/share ratio.
- **ERC-4626 Compatibility**: Implements standard preview and conversion functions.
- **Overflow Protection**: All intermediate products use `checked_mul` to prevent i128 overflow, with explicit panic messages.

## Rounding Rules

To protect the vault's solvency and prevent "dust" attacks, rounding rules are strictly applied:

- **Deposits**: 
    - `preview_deposit_to_shares`: Rounds **down** (user may receive slightly fewer shares).
- **Withdrawals**:
    - `withdraw(assets)`: Rounds **up** when calculating shares to burn (user burns slightly more shares to cover the asset amount).
    - `preview_withdraw(assets)`: Rounds **up** to match actual behavior.
- **Conversions**:
    - `convert_to_assets`: Rounds **down**.
    - `convert_to_shares`: Rounds **down**.

## Cross-Contract Integration Flow

### USDC Token Integration

```
Vault Contract → USDC Token Contract (via token::Client)
                  ↑
                  ├── transfer() - receive user funds
                  └── transfer() - return funds to user
```

**Integration Points**:
1. `deposit()`: Calls `token.transfer(user, vault, amount)`
2. `withdraw()`: Calls `token.transfer(vault, user, amount)`

**Assumptions**:
- USDC uses Stellar's Soroban Token interface
- 7 decimal places
- Standard token operations (transfer, balance, etc.)

### AI Agent Integration

```
AI Agent → Vault Contract
            ├── get_balance(user) - monitor positions (read-only, no TTL write)
            ├── get_shares(user) - monitor share balances (read-only)
            ├── touch_user_ttl(user) - optional TTL maintenance for idle users
            ├── get_total_deposits() - monitor TVL
            └── rebalance(strategy) - signal strategy changes
            ↓
     DepositEvent / WithdrawEvent (via Soroban events)
```

**Event Flow**:
1. User calls `deposit()` or `withdraw()`
2. Contract emits corresponding event
3. AI agent monitors events via RPC/subscription
4. Agent responds by calling `rebalance()` or adjusting off-chain state

Rotating the agent address is not instant — it goes through a 24-hour timelock.
See [Agent Update Timelock (Issue #317)](#agent-update-timelock-issue-317).

### Blend Protocol Integration

```
Vault Contract → Blend Protocol Contract
                 ↑
                 ├── submit_with_allowance() - lend USDC for yield
                 ├── submit() - withdraw from lending
                 └── balance() - check yield earned
```

The vault integrates with the Blend protocol to generate yield on deposited USDC. The AI agent triggers rebalancing to move funds into or out of Blend.

### DEX Liquidity Pool Integration (Issue #228)

```
Vault Contract → DEX Liquidity Pool Contract
                 ↑
                 ├── add_liquidity(from, asset, amount, min_out)    - provide USDC liquidity
                 ├── remove_liquidity(to, asset, amount, min_out)   - withdraw liquidity
                 └── balance(asset, user)                           - current position size
```

Alongside Blend lending, the vault can deploy idle USDC as single-asset
liquidity into a Stellar DEX pool. This backs the Balanced and Growth
strategies described in the README. In the legacy **single-protocol mode** the
two integrations are mutually exclusive at any point in time: `CurrentProtocol`
names at most one of `"blend"`, `"dex"`, or `"none"`.

Since Phase 2 this mutual exclusion is opt-out: see
[Multi-Protocol Allocation Model](#multi-protocol-allocation-model-phase-2)
below, where the vault deploys to Blend **and** the DEX simultaneously against a
basis-point split.

See [`docs/DEX_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/DEX_INTEGRATION.md) for the full interface
research and rationale.

#### Storage

| Key | Storage | Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|-------------|
| | `DataKey::DexPool` | Instance | Address | DEX liquidity pool contract address. Absent until `set_dex_pool` is called; any rebalance targeting `"dex"` panics with `DexPoolNotConfigured` while unset. |
| | `DataKey::CurrentProtocol` | Instance | Symbol | Set to `"dex"` once a supply leg succeeds. Shared with the Blend path — the vault is never deployed to both at once. |
| | `DataKey::ApprovalTtl` | Instance | u32 | Shared with Blend. Each supply leg approves the DEX pool to spend USDC until `current_ledger + ApprovalTtl`. |

`set_dex_pool(owner, pool_address)` is owner-only and probes the candidate
pool's `balance` entrypoint before storing the address, so a wrong or
non-conforming address is rejected at configuration time rather than at the
next rebalance. It initializes `CurrentProtocol` to `"none"` when unset and
emits `DexPoolConfiguredEvent`. There is no separate `DexApprovalTtl` key:
`set_approval_ttl` governs both integrations.

#### DexPoolClient interface

`DexPoolClient` is an internal adapter mirroring `BlendPoolClient`. It treats
the pool as a single-asset venue and derives actual amounts from the **vault's
own USDC balance delta** rather than trusting the pool's return value, so
partial fills and slippage are observable on-chain.

| Method | Pool call | Returns |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| | `supply(pool, asset, amount, min_out, to)` | `add_liquidity(from, asset, amount, min_out)` | `balance_before - balance_after` (USDC actually supplied) |
| | `withdraw(pool, asset, amount, min_out, to)` | `remove_liquidity(to, asset, amount, min_out)` | `balance_after - balance_before` (USDC actually received) |
| | `get_balance(pool, asset, user)` | `balance(asset, user)` | The vault's current liquidity position |

`min_out` is forwarded to the pool for its own slippage check, and the realized
delta is re-checked locally by `require_min_out`, which panics with
`MinOutNotMet` when `min_out > 0` and the leg came up short.

#### Idle vs deployed tracking with DEX positions

DEX positions participate in the same idle/deployed split described under
[Idle vs Deployed Asset Tracking](#idle-vs-deployed-asset-tracking-issue-321):

- `get_idle_balance()` reads the vault's own USDC token balance and is
  protocol-agnostic — supplying liquidity moves value out of it.
- `get_deployed_assets()` dispatches on `CurrentProtocol`. When it is `"dex"`,
  the figure comes from a live `balance(asset, vault)` call on the configured
  DEX pool.
- If `CurrentProtocol` is `"dex"` but `DexPool` is unset, `get_deployed_assets()`
  returns `0` rather than panicking. The read path tolerates an unconfigured
  pool; the write path (`rebalance`) does not.
- `get_asset_breakdown()` returns both figures from a single invocation, so
  they cannot straddle a rebalance.

Because `get_deployed_assets()` performs a cross-contract call, it costs
materially more than a plain storage getter — roughly the same order as the
Blend balance read in the resource table above.

#### Rebalance flow for DEX deployments

`rebalance("dex", expected_apy, min_out)` runs the same sequence as the Blend
path:

1. Guards: agent auth, not paused, `0 ≤ expected_apy ≤ 10 000`, `min_out ≥ 0`,
   protocol in the `{"blend", "dex", "none"}` allowlist, and the rebalance
   cooldown (`MinRebalanceInterval`) has elapsed.
2. **Exit leg.** If `CurrentProtocol` is a different non-`"none"` protocol, the
   vault fully exits it first. If a non-zero balance remains after the
   withdrawal, `RebalanceFailedEvent` is emitted and the call **returns without
   further state changes** — the transaction is not reverted, so the failure is
   observable on-chain (Issue #145).
3. Panic with `DexPoolNotConfigured` if `DataKey::DexPool` is unset.
4. **Supply leg.** The entire idle USDC balance is supplied: the vault approves
   the pool for `amount` until `current_ledger + ApprovalTtl`, authorizes the
   nested `add_liquidity` → `transfer_from` invocation via
   `authorize_as_current_contract`, then calls the pool. `CurrentProtocol` is
   set to `"dex"` only when the realized amount is positive.
5. **Noop case.** With zero idle USDC and nothing moved, `CurrentProtocol` is
   still set to `"dex"` so tracking matches intent, and the rebalance reports
   status `"noop"` (mirrors Blend, Issue #146).
6. `RebalanceEvent` is emitted with status `"success"`, `"partial"` (realized
   below the attempted amount), `"failed"` (realized zero), or `"noop"`.

Withdrawals follow the reverse path: `withdraw_from_dex(amount, min_out)` pulls
from the pool when idle USDC cannot cover a redemption, treating `amount == 0`
as "withdraw the entire position".

#### DEX-specific events

| Event | Topic | Emitted by | Payload |
|-------|-------|------------|---------|
| | `DexSupplyEvent` | `"dex_sup"` (`TOPIC_DEX_SUPPLY`) | supply leg of `rebalance("dex", ..)` | `asset`, `amount_actual` (balance-delta measured), `success` |
| | `DexWithdrawEvent` | `"dex_wd"` (`TOPIC_DEX_WITHDRAW`) | DEX exit leg of `rebalance` or a user redemption | `asset`, `amount_actual`, `success` |
| | `DexPoolConfiguredEvent` | `"dex_cfg"` (`TOPIC_DEX_POOL_CONFIGURED`) | `set_dex_pool` | `old_pool` (`None` on first configuration), `new_pool`, `owner` |

These are emitted **in addition to** the protocol-agnostic `RebalanceEvent` and
`ProtocolChangedEvent`. Indexers tracking which venue the vault is deployed to
should treat `ProtocolChangedEvent` as authoritative rather than inferring it
from supply/withdraw events. See [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) for payload field
descriptions.

## Asset Flow Diagrams

### Deposit Flow

1. User authorizes deposit transaction.
2. USDC transferred from user to vault.
3. Vault calculates shares to mint based on current `TotalAssets` and `TotalShares`.
4. User share balance updated in persistent storage.
5. `TotalAssets` and `TotalShares` updated in instance storage.
6. `DepositEvent` emitted.

### Withdraw Flow

1. User authorizes withdrawal transaction.
2. Vault calculates shares to burn (rounding up to protect vault).
3. If vault balance is insufficient, funds are withdrawn from active protocols (e.g., Blend).
4. User share balance updated in persistent storage.
5. `TotalAssets` and `TotalShares` updated in instance storage.
6. USDC transferred from vault to user.
7. `WithdrawEvent` emitted.

### Rebalance Flow (AI Agent)

1. AI agent evaluates market conditions.
2. Agent calls `rebalance(protocol, expected_apy, min_out)` on vault.
3. Vault verifies caller is agent, protocol is in `{"blend", "dex", "none"}`,
   and the `MinRebalanceInterval` cooldown has elapsed.
4. If already deployed elsewhere, vault exits the current protocol first. An
   incomplete exit emits `RebalanceFailedEvent` and aborts without further
   state changes.
5. Vault executes on-chain movement (supply to or withdraw from Blend or the
   DEX pool), emitting the protocol-specific supply/withdraw event.
6. `ProtocolChangedEvent` emitted if `CurrentProtocol` changed.
7. `RebalanceEvent` emitted with the outcome status.

## Multi-Protocol Allocation Model (Phase 2)

### Motivation

The original design tracked exactly one active venue in `CurrentProtocol`, so
100% of deployed capital always sat in a single protocol. That concentrates
protocol risk and does not match the Balanced and Growth strategy descriptions
in the README, which imply a diversified book. Phase 2 lets the vault hold
positions in Blend **and** the DEX at the same time against an explicit
basis-point split (e.g. 60% Blend / 40% DEX).

### Allocation representation

Allocation is expressed in basis points of the vault's **deployable assets**
(idle USDC + both live positions):

```
BlendAllocationBps + DexAllocationBps <= 10_000
```

A sum below `10_000` is legal and means the remainder is deliberately held
idle. Each leg is independently bounded to `0..=10_000`. Violations panic with
`VaultError::InvalidAllocation` (#77).

### Storage

| Key | Storage | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MultiProtocolEnabled` | Instance | `bool` | Mode flag. Absent/`false` = legacy single-protocol behaviour. |
| `BlendAllocationBps` | Instance | `u32` | Target Blend weight in basis points. |
| `DexAllocationBps` | Instance | `u32` | Target DEX weight in basis points. |
| `DeployedToBlend` | Instance | `i128` | Locally tracked USDC principal in Blend, refreshed after every leg. |
| `DeployedToDex` | Instance | `i128` | Locally tracked USDC principal in the DEX. |
| `BlendApyBps` | Instance | `u32` | Last agent-reported Blend APY. |
| `DexApyBps` | Instance | `u32` | Last agent-reported DEX APY. |

### `CurrentProtocol` compatibility

`CurrentProtocol` is **retained** and maintained as a derived summary so every
existing consumer (`get_current_protocol`, `harvest`, `emergency_harvest`,
`withdraw`, `get_deployed_assets`, indexers) keeps working unchanged:

| Blend position | DEX position | `CurrentProtocol` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | `"none"` |
| > 0 | 0 | `"blend"` |
| 0 | > 0 | `"dex"` |
| > 0 | > 0 | `"multi"` |

`"multi"` is a new summary value. Internally, `get_protocol_balance("multi")`
returns the sum of both venues, and `withdraw_amount_from_protocol("multi")`
dispatches to the proportional withdrawal path. Authoritative per-venue state
is always `BlendAllocationBps` / `DexAllocationBps` and the deployment getters.

### Rebalance flow (`rebalance_multi`)

`rebalance_multi(blend_bps, dex_bps, min_out)` is agent-only, pause-gated, and
subject to the same rebalance cooldown as `rebalance`. It converges to the
target split **withdraw-first** so the vault never attempts to supply USDC it
has not yet recovered:

1. Validate mode, allocation bounds, `min_out`, cooldown, and that each venue
   with a non-zero weight has a pool configured.
2. Compute `deployable = idle + blend_balance + dex_balance`, then each venue's
   target as `deployable * bps / 10_000`. Integer-division remainders stay idle.
3. **Exit legs.** Any venue holding more than its target is withdrawn down by
   the excess.
4. **Entry legs.** Any venue holding less than its target is topped up, capped
   by the idle balance actually on hand after step 3.
5. Persist the new split, re-sync `DeployedToBlend`/`DeployedToDex` from live
   pool balances, and refresh the derived `CurrentProtocol` summary.
6. Emit `ProtocolAllocationChangedEvent`, then `RebalanceEvent` with
   `protocol = "multi"` and the composite APY, and fold the outcome into the
   circuit breaker.

A shortfall on an exit leg is not fatal: the un-recovered amount simply remains
in place and is corrected on the next rebalance, keeping the vault solvent.

### Proportional withdrawal

When a redemption cannot be satisfied from idle USDC and `CurrentProtocol` is
`"multi"`, `withdraw_proportionally` pulls from each venue **in proportion to
what it currently holds**, rather than draining one venue first:

```
from_blend = needed * blend_balance / (blend_balance + dex_balance)
from_dex   = needed - from_blend
```

Each leg is clamped to the venue's actual balance, with any excess spilled to
the other venue so the vault never under-pulls. This preserves the target
ratio across redemptions: a 60/40 book that serves a 50% withdrawal is still
60/40 afterwards. `withdraw`, `withdraw_all`, and `emergency_withdraw` all route
through this path.

### Composite yield

The agent reports each venue's observed APY with
`set_protocol_apy(protocol, apy_bps)`. `get_composite_apy()` returns the
allocation-weighted blend:

```
composite_bps = (blend_bps * blend_apy_bps + dex_bps * dex_apy_bps) / 10_000
```

Idle capital correctly dilutes the headline number: 60/40 at 800/1200 bps
reports 960 bps, while a 50%-deployed book at 800 bps reports 400 bps. In
single-protocol mode the active venue is treated as a 100% weight, so the getter
is meaningful in both modes.

### Migration path

`enable_multi_protocol(enabled)` is owner-only and **moves no funds**. Enabling
seeds the allocation from the vault's current position so the migration is a
pure bookkeeping change:

| Pre-migration `CurrentProtocol` | Seeded `(blend_bps, dex_bps)` |
| --- | --- |
| `"blend"` | `(10_000, 0)` |
| `"dex"` | `(0, 10_000)` |
| `"none"` | `(0, 0)` |

The agent then calls `rebalance_multi` to move to the desired split. Disabling
collapses back to single-protocol mode and is only permitted when at most one
venue holds a position — otherwise the legacy `CurrentProtocol` symbol could not
describe the vault's full state, so the call panics with `InvalidAllocation`.
Instances that never call `enable_multi_protocol` are byte-for-byte unaffected:
the flag defaults to `false` and `rebalance` retains its mutual-exclusion
semantics.

### New API surface

| Function | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enable_multi_protocol(enabled)` | Owner | Migrate into/out of multi-protocol mode. |
| `is_multi_protocol_enabled()` | Public | Mode flag. |
| `rebalance_multi(blend_bps, dex_bps, min_out)` | Agent | Converge to a target split. |
| `get_allocation()` | Public | `(blend_bps, dex_bps)`. |
| `get_deployed_to_blend()` | Public | Live Blend position. |
| `get_deployed_to_dex()` | Public | Live DEX position. |
| `get_protocol_breakdown()` | Public | Both, read atomically. |
| `set_protocol_apy(protocol, apy_bps)` | Agent | Report a venue's APY. |
| `get_protocol_apy(protocol)` | Public | Last reported APY. |
| `get_composite_apy()` | Public | Allocation-weighted APY. |

### New events

| Event | Topic | Emitted by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ProtocolAllocationChangedEvent` | `alloc_chg` | `rebalance_multi` |
| `MultiProtocolModeChangedEvent` | `multi_md` | `enable_multi_protocol` |
| `ProtocolApyUpdatedEvent` | `apy_upd` | `set_protocol_apy` |

### New error codes

| Code | Variant | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 77 | `InvalidAllocation` | Leg out of range, legs sum above 10_000, or an unrepresentable downgrade. |
| 78 | `MultiProtocolNotEnabled` | `rebalance_multi` called in single-protocol mode. |
| 79 | `MultiProtocolEnabledError` | Reserved for calls that require single-protocol mode. |

## Upgrade Model

### Storage Preservation

When upgrading the contract, the following storage keys must be preserved:

- `Shares(Address)` and `Balance(Address)`
- `TotalDeposits`, `TotalShares`, `TotalAssets`
- `Agent`, `UsdcToken`, `Owner`, `Paused`
- `TvLCap`, `UserDepositCap`, `ApprovalTtl`, `MinDeposit`, `MaxDeposit`
- `BlendPool`, `DexPool`, `CurrentProtocol`
- `MultiProtocolEnabled`, `BlendAllocationBps`, `DexAllocationBps`
- `DeployedToBlend`, `DeployedToDex`, `BlendApyBps`, `DexApyBps`
- `UserStrategy(Address)`
- `MinRebalanceInterval`, `LastRebalanceLedger`
- `PendingAgent`, `AgentTimelockExpiry` (if an agent update is mid-flight)
- `Version` (incremented by `execute_upgrade`)

`PendingUpgradeHash` and `UpgradeTimelockExpiry` are deliberately **not**
preserved: `execute_upgrade` clears them before applying the new WASM, so the
upgraded contract starts with no proposal pending.

### Version History

| Version | Changes | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| | 1 | Initial 1:1 balance accounting (no shares) | Historical — superseded |
| | 2 | ERC-4626 share accounting, Blend integration, rounding rules | **Current** |
| | 3 | (Planned) Multi-asset support and advanced rebalancing | Future |

`Version` is incremented by `execute_upgrade`, not by `schedule_upgrade`.
Scheduling an upgrade that is later cancelled leaves `Version` untouched, so
`get_version()` always reflects the WASM actually running.

## Error Handling

Errors are surfaced as typed `VaultError` contract errors rather than raw panic
strings. See [ERROR_STYLE_GUIDE.md](ERROR_STYLE_GUIDE.md) for the full code
table and wording conventions.

### Key error codes by function

| Function | VaultError variant (code) | Condition |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| | `initialize` | `AlreadyInitialized` (#4) | Called more than once |
| | `deposit` | `Paused` (#35) | Vault is paused |
| | `deposit` | `AmountMustBePositive` (#37) | amount ≤ 0 |
| | `deposit` | `BelowMinimumDeposit` (#38) | amount < min_deposit |
| | `deposit` | `ExceedsUserDepositCap` (#40) | user cumulative > cap |
| | `deposit` | `ExceedsTvlCap` (#41) | total_assets + amount > tvl_cap |
| | `withdraw` | `Paused` (#35) | Vault is paused |
| | `withdraw` | `AmountMustBePositive` (#37) | amount ≤ 0 |
| | `withdraw` | `InsufficientShares` (#8) | shares to burn > user shares |
| | `rebalance` | `Paused` (#35) | Vault is paused |
| | `unpause` | `NotPaused` (#21) | Called when not paused |

### Return Values

All read functions return the requested data or 0/default if not set.

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests

- Deposit with valid amount
- Deposit with minimum amount (boundary)
- Deposit exceeding cap (should fail)
- Withdraw with sufficient balance
- Withdraw exceeding balance (should fail)
- Pause/unpause by owner
- Pause by non-owner (should fail)

### Integration Tests

- Full deposit → rebalance → withdraw flow
- Multiple users depositing and withdrawing
- TVL cap enforcement
- User deposit cap enforcement
- Emergency pause during active deposits

## Gas Considerations

### Instance Storage Operations

- Read: ~1-2 gas units
- Write: ~2-3 gas units
- Use for: Configuration, totals, flags

### Persistent Storage Operations

- Read: ~1 gas unit
- Write: ~1-2 gas units
- Use for: User balances

### Optimization Strategies

1. Batch reads when possible
2. Use instance storage for frequently accessed globals
3. Use persistent storage for user-specific data

## Ledger Resource Baselines (Issue #203)

Measured in the Soroban simulator against `soroban-env-host 21.2.1` with the
MockBlendPool and TestToken test helpers. Upper bounds used as strict regression
gates (baseline + 10% tolerance) in `tests/test_budget.rs`.

| Operation | CPU instructions | Memory bytes |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| | `deposit` | 4,500,000 + 10% | 270,000 + 10% |
| | `withdraw` (no Blend) | 4,500,000 + 10% | 270,000 + 10% |
| | `withdraw` (Blend pull) | 13,500,000 + 10% | 540,000 + 10% |
| | `rebalance → blend` | 13,500,000 + 10% | 540,000 + 10% |
| | `rebalance → none` | 13,500,000 + 10% | 540,000 + 10% |
| | `harvest` | 13,500,000 + 10% | 540,000 + 10% |

Cross-contract operations (Blend supply/withdraw) cost roughly 3× a simple
deposit because each `invoke_contract` carries its own CPU and memory overhead.

## Storage-Griefing Analysis (Issue #598)

This section analyzes whether an attacker can spam many small deposits to
inflate the vault's persistent/instance storage footprint, raising rent costs
or CPU/memory budget for honest users. Short answer: `min_deposit` + `TvlCap`
together bound the number of *distinct new entries* an attacker can create,
but `UserSharesIndex`'s all-in-one-`Vec`, never-pruned design means the *cost
of each new entry* rises as the index grows — this is a real, measured effect,
not just a theoretical one. See below for the numbers.

### What can actually grow

| Storage item | Category | Growth trigger | Pruned on withdrawal? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Shares(Address)` | Persistent, per-user | First deposit from a new address | No — `withdraw`/`withdraw_all` `set` the entry to `0`, they never `remove()` it (see `lib.rs` around the `Shares(user)` writes in `deposit`/`withdraw`/`withdraw_all`) |
| `UserStrategy(Address)` | Persistent, per-user | First deposit from a new address (defaults to `"balanced"`) | No — never removed |
| `UserSharesIndex` | **Instance**, single `Vec<Address>` | First deposit from an address with `current_shares == 0` (new *or* returning after a full withdrawal, deduped via `Vec::contains`) | No — append-only by design (see `add_to_user_index`); `get_users_with_shares`'s doc comment calls this out explicitly as the accepted trade-off for issue #440 |

A dust depositor therefore leaves behind three storage artifacts that live
forever: a zeroed `Shares` entry, a `UserStrategy` entry, and one slot in
`UserSharesIndex`. None of the three are reclaimed by any code path today.

### Entry-count bound derived from `min_deposit` + `TvlCap`

`require_within_tvl_cap` checks cumulative `TotalAssets`, not the number of
distinct depositing addresses, and `require_minimum_deposit` only enforces a
*floor* per transaction (`DEFAULT_MIN_DEPOSIT` = 1_000_000 stroops = 1 USDC).
Combining the two gives a hard ceiling on how many distinct new
`Shares`/`UserStrategy`/`UserSharesIndex` entries an attacker can create
before the vault simply refuses further deposits:

```
max_new_entries = TvlCap / min_deposit
```

At the as-deployed defaults (`DEFAULT_TVL_CAP` = 100_000_000_000,
`DEFAULT_MIN_DEPOSIT` = 1_000_000):

```
max_new_entries = 100_000_000_000 / 1_000_000 = 100_000 distinct entries
```

This bound is **owner-adjustable in both directions** — `set_tvl_cap()` and
`set_deposit_limits()` are both owner-only (`require_is_owner`), so the
ceiling moves if either configuration value changes. A vault operator raising
`TvlCap` without also raising `min_deposit` widens this ceiling; that
trade-off should be considered together, not just for capital efficiency.

An attacker who wants to maximize entry count for minimum locked capital will
always deposit exactly `min_deposit` per address (any more just wastes their
own capital without creating additional entries), and — since the index
dedupes on repeat depositors — will always prefer a **new** address per dust
deposit over re-depositing from an existing one, since only the former grows
`UserSharesIndex`.

### Budget impact: cost is not flat as the index grows

`add_to_user_index` reads the *entire* `UserSharesIndex` Vec into memory,
linear-scans it with `Vec::contains`, and — for a genuinely new address —
rewrites the whole Vec back to instance storage. Because this runs on every
first-time (or returning-after-full-withdrawal) deposit, the CPU and memory
cost of `deposit()` itself grows with the **total number of distinct
addresses that have ever held shares**, not with the size of the deposit.

`tests/test_storage_griefing_analysis.rs` measures this directly, using the
same `measure()` budget-reset harness as `tests/test_budget.rs`:

| Scenario | CPU instructions | Memory bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit()`, index size 0 → 1 (baseline) | 366,078 | 39,841 |
| `deposit()`, index size 500 → 501 | 5,077,759 | 2,005,493 |

At only 500 prior distinct depositors, a first-time depositor's `deposit()`
call already costs **~13.9× the CPU** and **~50× the memory** of the
empty-index baseline — and both numbers keep climbing linearly as more
distinct addresses deposit. This is the sharper form of "storage griefing"
here: the attacker isn't just leaving behind rent-bearing entries, they are
raising the *compute* cost every future first-time depositor pays, on a
resource (`Instance` storage, which has no TTL/rent decay at all — see
[Storage Layout](#storage-layout) above) that never shrinks back down.

At the default 100,000-entry ceiling derived above, linear extrapolation
puts a single `deposit()` call's cost in the range that would make it
expensive relative to the `< 5,000,000` CPU / `< 300,000` byte baseline
`tests/test_budget.rs` treats as normal — plausibly budget-prohibitive well
before Soroban's hard per-transaction resource ceiling, though the exact
crossover has not been measured beyond the 500-entry data point above (a
500,000+ chained-call test is impractical to run in the unit-test simulator;
this would need a dedicated devnet/loadtest measurement to pin down exactly,
similar in spirit to `test_blend_devnet.rs`/`test_dex_devnet.rs`).

### Mitigations: current and possible

**Already in place:**
- `min_deposit` (owner-configurable, default 1 USDC) — makes the attack cost
  capital proportional to entries created; it is not free.
- `TvlCap` (owner-configurable) — puts a hard ceiling on total entries
  regardless of `min_deposit`, as derived above.
- `get_users_with_shares` pagination already tolerates and documents stale
  (zero-share) index slots, so downstream indexers are not broken by the
  index's unbounded growth — only on-chain compute/storage cost is at risk,
  not off-chain read correctness.

**Not currently implemented (flagged here for maintainers, not attempted in
this change to avoid an unreviewed contract-logic modification):**
- **Prune-on-full-withdrawal**: removing an address from `UserSharesIndex`
  (and its `Shares`/`UserStrategy` entries) when its share balance returns to
  exactly zero would cap the index at "currently active holders" rather than
  "all-time holders." This is a real contract-logic change with its own
  risk surface (e.g., `UserSharesIndex` is a flat `Vec`, so removing a middle
  element is either an O(n) shift or requires switching to a swap-remove +
  documented reordering, which would be a breaking change for any indexer
  relying on positional stability) and is out of scope for this
  documentation-only issue.
- **Per-address minimum "stickiness" period or an explicit unstake/prune
  entrypoint** callable by anyone once a `Shares` entry has been zero for a
  cooldown window, amortizing cleanup cost onto whoever benefits from it
  rather than the protocol.
- **Raising `min_deposit` further** tightens `max_new_entries` immediately
  with zero contract changes, at the cost of excluding legitimate small
  depositors — a policy lever, not a code change.

## Idle vs Deployed Asset Tracking (Issue #321)

The vault distinguishes between two components of its total managed value:

| Component | Getter | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| | **Idle** | `get_idle_balance()` | USDC held directly in the vault contract, not yet deployed to any protocol. |
| | **Deployed** | `get_deployed_assets()` | USDC currently supplied to an external yield protocol (e.g., Blend, DEX). |

Both values are also available in a single atomic call via `get_asset_breakdown()`, which returns `(idle, deployed)` — useful for dashboards and AI agents that need both figures without two separate RPC round-trips.

### How idle balance changes

- **Increases** on `deposit()` (user transfers USDC into the vault).
- **Decreases** on `rebalance()` when the agent supplies idle USDC to a protocol.
- **Increases** on `rebalance()` or `withdraw()` when funds are pulled back from a protocol.

### How deployed assets change

- **Increases** after a successful `rebalance()` into Blend or the DEX.
- **Decreases** after `rebalance()` to `"none"` (full protocol exit) or after
  partial/full protocol withdrawals triggered by user redemptions.
- Returns `0` when `CurrentProtocol` is `"none"` — no funds are deployed.

### Relationship to TotalAssets

`idle + deployed` may differ from `TotalAssets`.  `TotalAssets` is the
authoritative accounting value used for share pricing and includes accrued yield
as reported by the agent via `update_total_assets()`.  The live balance getters
query on-chain token balances directly and therefore represent the current
on-chain state before any yield reporting adjustment.

## TotalDeposits vs TotalAssets Relationship (Issues #183, #299)

Two separate values track vault accounting:

| Field | Updated by | Includes yield? | Used for |
|-------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| | `TotalDeposits` | `deposit`, `withdraw` | No | Principal bookkeeping, reporting only |
| | `TotalAssets` | `deposit`, `withdraw`, `update_total_assets` | Yes | Share pricing, TVL cap guard, all economic math |

**Design decision (issue #299):** `TotalDeposits` is intentionally *not* synced
when `update_total_assets()` is called.  It is a principal-only counter.
`TotalAssets` is the authoritative value for all economic calculations and cap
enforcement.

**TVL cap check uses `TotalAssets`**: after yield accrual `TotalAssets` can
exceed `TotalDeposits`.  The cap must compare against `TotalAssets` to prevent
additional deposits from pushing total managed value past the intended limit.
Checking `TotalDeposits` instead would allow over-subscription once yield has
grown the vault past the cap.

**Share pricing**: `share_price = TotalAssets / TotalShares`.  All economic
quantities (user balance, redemption amount) derive from `TotalAssets`, not
`TotalDeposits`.

**Regression tests**: `tests/test_total_assets_cap.rs` covers the full lifecycle:
deposit → yield accrual → withdrawal → cap check, confirming that `TotalAssets`
diverges from `TotalDeposits` after yield and that cap guards remain correct.

## Formal Invariant Register

This section documents the seven core invariants that must hold at every
transaction boundary. Each invariant is stated formally, followed by a proof
sketch grounded in the contract's execution model, the known violation windows
(mid-transaction states), and the tests / fuzz targets that enforce it.

> **Reading note for auditors:** "transaction boundary" means the point at
> which a Soroban transaction commits or reverts. Soroban's single-threaded
> execution model means no two transactions can concurrently mutate shared
> storage, so every invariant below holds atomically.

---

### I-1 — Share Sum Consistency

**Statement:** The sum of all individual user share balances equals
`TotalShares`.

```
∑ Shares(u)  ==  TotalShares
```

**Why it holds:** `deposit()` atomically increments `Shares(user)` and
`TotalShares` by the same `shares_minted` value within a single transaction.
`withdraw()` atomically decrements `Shares(user)` and `TotalShares` by the
same `shares_burned` value. There is no code path that touches one counter
without touching the other — the only writers are the deposit and withdraw
functions, and both use checked arithmetic to prevent silent corruption. Because
Soroban transactions execute single-threaded and changes commit atomically, no
partial-update window can leave the counters out of sync.

**Known violation windows:** None — no mid-transaction observable state exists
for external callers.

**Enforcing tests / fuzz targets:**
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` — checks sum after every
  operation sequence.
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/deposit_withdraw_sequence.rs` — exercises arbitrary
  interleaved deposit/withdraw sequences.
- `tests/test_balance_shares_invariant.rs` — unit-level assertion over
  multi-user scenarios.
- `tests/test_shares.rs` — verifies share mint/burn symmetry.

---

### I-2 — Proportional Balance

**Statement:** A user's redeemable USDC balance equals their proportional share
of `TotalAssets`, rounded down.

```
user_balance(u)  ==  floor( Shares(u) × TotalAssets / TotalShares )
```

**Why it holds:** `get_balance(user)` is computed directly from this formula at
read time — it is not a stored field that can drift. The numerator
`Shares(u) × TotalAssets` uses `checked_mul` to prevent overflow, and integer
division floors the result. Because `TotalAssets` is the authoritative share
price denominator (updated only by `deposit`, `withdraw`, and
`update_total_assets`), the formula always reflects the latest committed state.

**Known violation windows:** None for external reads. Internally, during a
`deposit` or `withdraw` transaction, `TotalAssets` and `TotalShares` are updated
together before `Shares(user)` is written — but the transaction commits
atomically, so an external observer never sees a partially-updated state.

**Enforcing tests / fuzz targets:**
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` — verifies the formula
  holds after every fuzzed operation.
- `tests/test_balance_shares_invariant.rs` — explicit assertion of the
  proportionality formula.
- `tests/test_rounding_math.rs` — boundary checks for the floor rounding
  direction.

---

### I-3 — Non-Negative Yield

**Statement:** Total managed assets are always at least equal to total principal
deposited; yield is never negative.

```
TotalAssets  >=  TotalDeposits
```

**Why it holds:** `deposit()` increments both `TotalAssets` and `TotalDeposits`
by the same `amount`. `withdraw()` decrements `TotalAssets` by the assets
returned and `TotalDeposits` by the same amount. `update_total_assets()` can
only *increase* `TotalAssets` — the function rejects any value below the
current `TotalAssets`, bounding the maximum decrease per call to ≤10% via
basis-point guard. Because `TotalAssets` starts equal to `TotalDeposits` at
initialization and can only grow (or decrease only through legitimate
withdrawals that mirror the `TotalDeposits` decrement), `TotalAssets` ≥
`TotalDeposits` is always preserved.

**Known violation windows:** None. There is no code path that increases
`TotalDeposits` without a matching increase to `TotalAssets`, and no code path
decreases `TotalAssets` below `TotalDeposits`.

**Enforcing tests / fuzz targets:**
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` — asserts the inequality
  after every operation.
- `tests/test_total_assets_cap.rs` — full lifecycle test: deposit → yield
  accrual → withdrawal, confirming `TotalAssets` ≥ `TotalDeposits` throughout.

---

### I-4 — Per-User Share Bound

**Statement:** No individual user can hold more shares than the total supply.

```
Shares(u)  <=  TotalShares   for all u
```

**Why it holds:** `Shares(u)` is set to `0` before a user's first deposit and
then incremented strictly by the value added to `TotalShares` in the same
transaction (I-1). Because `TotalShares` is the sum of all user shares and every
user share is non-negative, no single entry can exceed the sum. I-1 is the
stronger invariant; I-4 is a direct corollary.

**Known violation windows:** None.

**Enforcing tests / fuzz targets:**
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` — asserts per-user bound
  after every operation sequence.
- `tests/test_shares.rs` — verifies individual share balances do not exceed
  `TotalShares`.

---

### I-5 — Per-User Asset Bound

**Statement:** No individual user's redeemable balance can exceed the total
assets managed by the vault.

```
user_balance(u)  <=  TotalAssets   for all u
```

**Why it holds:** `user_balance(u)` is derived from I-2:
`floor(Shares(u) × TotalAssets / TotalShares)`. Because `Shares(u) ≤
TotalShares` (I-4) and `TotalAssets ≥ 0`, the result is bounded above by
`floor(TotalShares × TotalAssets / TotalShares) = TotalAssets`. This bound
tightens further when multiple users share the pool. Checked arithmetic ensures
no overflow path could produce a spuriously large value.

**Known violation windows:** None.

**Enforcing tests / fuzz targets:**
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` — combined assertion
  following each deposit or withdraw.
- `tests/test_balance_shares_invariant.rs` — explicit per-user ceiling check.

---

### I-6 — Non-Decreasing Exchange Rate

**Statement:** The exchange rate (assets per share, expressed in 7-decimal
fixed-point) is always at least 1.0, and never decreases over time.

```
get_exchange_rate()  >=  10_000_000   (i.e., rate >= 1.0 in 7-decimal fixed point)
```

**Why it holds:** At bootstrap (first deposit, when `TotalShares == 0` or
`TotalAssets == 0`), `shares_minted = assets` (1:1), so `TotalAssets ==
TotalShares` and the rate starts exactly at `10_000_000`. Thereafter,
`update_total_assets()` can only increase `TotalAssets` without changing
`TotalShares`, which strictly increases the rate. Withdrawals decrease both
`TotalAssets` and `TotalShares` proportionally (shares burned map to the exact
asset amount returned), so the rate is unchanged by withdrawals. New deposits
also preserve the rate: `shares_minted = floor(amount × TotalShares /
TotalAssets)` is floored, meaning the depositor may receive slightly fewer
shares than the exact proportional share, which can only benefit (or not change)
the rate for existing holders.

**Known violation windows:** None. The floor-on-deposit and
increase-only-`update_total_assets` constraints together prevent any decrease.

**Enforcing tests / fuzz targets:**
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` — asserts
  `get_exchange_rate() >= 10_000_000` after every operation.
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/rounding_boundaries.rs` — stress-tests the floor/ceil
  rounding directions at deposit and withdrawal boundaries.
- `tests/test_exchange_rate.rs` — unit tests for bootstrap, yield accrual, and
  post-withdrawal rate stability.
- `tests/test_rounding_math.rs` — verifies rounding direction does not depress
  the rate.

---

### I-7 — Idle + Deployed vs TotalAssets (Informational)

**Statement:** The sum of idle balance and deployed assets is observable but
may differ from `TotalAssets`. `TotalAssets` is the single authoritative value
for all share pricing; `idle + deployed` reflects live on-chain balances before
any pending yield reporting.

```
get_idle_balance() + get_deployed_assets()  ≈  TotalAssets
  (equality holds only after update_total_assets() has been called with the
   latest yield figure; otherwise idle+deployed may be < TotalAssets)
```

**Why the difference exists:** `TotalAssets` is updated by the AI agent via
`update_total_assets(new_total)` to report yield earned in external protocols
(e.g., accrued Blend interest). Until the agent makes that call, `TotalAssets`
reflects the last reported total while the live on-chain balances (`idle +
deployed`) may be lower (before reporting) or higher (after yield has accrued
in Blend but before the vault has been notified). The idle getter reads the
vault's own USDC token balance directly; the deployed getter performs a live
cross-contract call to the active protocol. Neither modifies `TotalAssets`.

**Design rationale:** Using a single authoritative `TotalAssets` for share
pricing isolates the pricing model from the latency of cross-contract balance
reads and from potential protocol-side rounding artefacts. The idle/deployed
split is provided as an operational observability aid for dashboards and the AI
agent, not as an accounting primitive.

**Known violation windows:** The gap between `idle + deployed` and `TotalAssets`
is always present to some degree in a live vault; it is not an error condition.
The two figures converge after `update_total_assets()` reports the latest yield.

**Enforcing tests / fuzz targets:**
- `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` — verifies that
  `TotalAssets` is the value used for share math, not `idle + deployed`.
- `tests/test_total_assets_cap.rs` — confirms `TotalAssets` diverges from raw
  balance after yield accrual and that share pricing uses `TotalAssets`.

## expected_apy Validation (Issue #185)

`rebalance(protocol, expected_apy)` validates `0 ≤ expected_apy ≤ 10 000`
(basis points, where 10 000 = 100 %).  Values outside this range are rejected
with `vault: expected_apy out of range (0-10000 bps)`.

The field is **informational for indexers** — it is emitted in `RebalanceEvent`
but does not influence on-chain fund movement.  Off-chain consumers (AI agent,
dashboards) use it to audit that the expected yield reported at rebalance time
is plausible.

## Agent Update Timelock (Issue #317)

The agent address is the only key allowed to call `rebalance()`, so replacing it
hands control of fund movement to a new keypair. Rotating the agent therefore
requires two transactions separated by a mandatory delay, giving users and
monitoring systems a window to observe the pending rotation and react before it
takes effect.

```
update_agent(new_agent)                confirm_agent_update()
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
   [ pending ] ───── AGENT_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS ──▶ [ applied ]
        │               (17,280 ≈ 24 h)
        │
        └── cancel_agent_update() ──▶ [ cleared ]
```

### Flow

| Function | Auth | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| | `update_agent(new_agent)` | owner | Records `PendingAgent` and sets `AgentTimelockExpiry = current_ledger + AGENT_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS`. The active `Agent` is **unchanged**. Emits `AgentUpdateProposedEvent`. |
| | `confirm_agent_update()` | owner | Requires `current_ledger >= AgentTimelockExpiry`. Writes `PendingAgent` into `Agent` and clears both pending keys. Emits `AgentUpdateConfirmedEvent` **and** `AgentUpdatedEvent`. |
| | `cancel_agent_update()` | owner | Clears both pending keys so a new proposal can be made. Emits `AgentUpdateCancelledEvent`. |
| | `get_pending_agent_update()` | none (read-only) | Returns `Some((pending_agent, effective_ledger))` while a proposal is pending, else `None`. |

`update_agent()` is the propose step only — it is deliberately *not* an instant
setter. Until `confirm_agent_update()` succeeds, `get_agent()` still returns the
old address and only the old agent can call `rebalance()`.

**Constant:** `AGENT_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS = 17_280` ledgers. At Stellar's ~5 s per
ledger that is ≈ 86,400 s = 24 hours. It matches `UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS` so
both privileged-role changes share one recovery window.

### Storage keys

Both live in instance storage and are cleared on confirm *and* on cancel.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| | `DataKey::PendingAgent` | `Address` | Proposed agent awaiting confirmation. Its presence is what makes an update "pending". |
| | `DataKey::AgentTimelockExpiry` | `u32` | First ledger sequence at which `confirm_agent_update()` may be called. |

### Events

| Event | Topic | Payload |
|-------|-------|---------|
| | `AgentUpdateProposedEvent` | `"agt_prop"` | `old_agent`, `new_agent`, `effective_ledger` |
| | `AgentUpdateConfirmedEvent` | `"agt_conf"` | `old_agent`, `new_agent` |
| | `AgentUpdateCancelledEvent` | `"agt_cncl"` | `old_agent`, `proposed_new_agent` |

`confirm_agent_update()` additionally re-emits the pre-timelock
`AgentUpdatedEvent` (`"agent"`) so indexers that already track that topic see
the rotation without changes. See [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) for payload field
descriptions.

### Security rationale

An owner key compromise is the highest-impact failure mode for the vault: the
agent controls where deposited USDC is deployed. Without a delay, an attacker
holding the owner key could swap in an attacker-controlled agent and immediately
rebalance funds into a hostile "protocol" in a single transaction — no observer
would have time to react.

The timelock converts that into a 24-hour detectable event:

- The proposal is public on-chain the moment it is made
  (`AgentUpdateProposedEvent` carries the target address and the exact ledger at
  which it unlocks), so monitoring can alert on it.
- During the window the legitimate owner — or a recovered multisig quorum — can
  call `cancel_agent_update()` to void the proposal, and can `pause()` the vault
  to freeze `rebalance()` entirely while the incident is handled.
- Because only one proposal may be pending at a time, an attacker cannot spam
  proposals to bury the real one; changing the target requires cancelling first,
  which restarts the full 24-hour clock.

### Invariants

- Only one proposal may be pending at a time. Calling `update_agent()` while
  `PendingAgent` exists panics with `TimelockAlreadyPending`.
- `confirm_agent_update()` or `cancel_agent_update()` with no proposal panics
  with `NoTimelockPending`; confirming before the expiry ledger panics with
  `TimelockNotExpired`.
- `TimelockAlreadyPending`, `NoTimelockPending`, and `TimelockNotExpired` are
  shared with the upgrade timelock (Issue #316) because `#[contracterror]` caps
  the enum at 50 variants.
- All three entrypoints require owner auth. A pending proposal grants the
  proposed agent no privileges whatsoever until confirmation.
- `cancel_agent_update()` is not pause-gated, so the escape hatch stays
  available while the vault is paused.

`neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_agent_timelock.rs`.

## Upgrade Safety (Issues #189, #316)

Contract upgrades are protected by two independent guards: a pause guard
(Issue #189) and a two-step timelock (Issue #316).

### Pause guard (Issue #189)

`schedule_upgrade()` and `execute_upgrade()` are both gated by
`require_not_paused()`. During an incident the operator pauses the vault to
freeze user operations; the upgrade guard ensures that a compromised or
mistaken WASM upgrade cannot be pushed while the vault is in a degraded state.
To upgrade: unpause → schedule → wait out the timelock → execute → re-pause if
needed.

`cancel_upgrade()` is deliberately **not** pause-gated, so the escape hatch
stays available even while the vault is paused.

### Two-step timelocked upgrade (Issue #316)

The instant `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` entrypoint has been removed. Replacing the
contract's WASM now requires two transactions separated by a mandatory delay,
which gives users and monitoring systems a window to observe a pending code
change and react to a malicious or mistaken proposal before it takes effect.

```
schedule_upgrade(owner, hash)          execute_upgrade(owner)
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
   [ pending ] ──── UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS ──▶ [ applied ]
        │              (17,280 ≈ 24 h)
        │
        └── cancel_upgrade(owner) ──▶ [ cleared ]
```

| Function | Auth | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| | `schedule_upgrade(owner, new_wasm_hash)` | owner, not paused | Records `PendingUpgradeHash` and sets `UpgradeTimelockExpiry = current_ledger + UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS`. Emits `UpgradeScheduledEvent`. |
| | `execute_upgrade(owner)` | owner, not paused | Requires `current_ledger >= UpgradeTimelockExpiry`. Clears both keys, applies the WASM, increments `Version`. Emits `UpgradedEvent`. |
| | `cancel_upgrade(owner)` | owner | Clears both keys so a new proposal can be scheduled. Emits `UpgradeCancelledEvent`. |
| | `get_pending_upgrade()` | none (read-only) | Returns `Some((wasm_hash, effective_ledger))` while a proposal is pending, else `None`. |

**Constant:** `UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS = 17_280` ledgers. At Stellar's ~5 s
per ledger that is ≈ 86,400 s = 24 hours. It matches `AGENT_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS`
so both privileged-role changes share one recovery window.

**Storage keys** (instance storage, both cleared on execute *and* on cancel):

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| | `DataKey::PendingUpgradeHash` | `BytesN<32>` | WASM hash awaiting execution. Its presence is what makes an upgrade "pending". |
| | `DataKey::UpgradeTimelockExpiry` | `u32` | First ledger sequence at which `execute_upgrade()` may be called. |

**Events:** `UpgradeScheduledEvent` (`"upg_sched"`), `UpgradeCancelledEvent`
(`"upg_cncl"`), and `UpgradedEvent` (`"upgraded"`, now emitted by
`execute_upgrade` rather than the removed instant path). See
[EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) for payload fields.

**Invariants:**

- Only one proposal may be pending at a time. Scheduling while
  `PendingUpgradeHash` exists panics with `TimelockAlreadyPending`; to change
  the target hash, cancel first and re-schedule (restarting the 24-hour clock).
- `execute_upgrade()` with no proposal panics with `NoTimelockPending`; before
  the expiry ledger it panics with `TimelockNotExpired`.
- `TimelockAlreadyPending`, `NoTimelockPending`, and `TimelockNotExpired` are
  shared with the agent timelock (Issue #317) because `#[contracterror]` caps
  the enum at 50 variants.
- The pending keys are cleared *before* `update_current_contract_wasm` is
  called, so a fresh proposal can always be scheduled after execution.
- A pending proposal has no effect on the running code. Until
  `execute_upgrade()` succeeds, the deployed WASM is unchanged.

4. Minimize state changes in single transaction

## Stale-State & Checks-Effects-Interactions Audit (Issue #568)

To prevent stale-state vulnerabilities where storage reads performed after cross-contract calls observe externally influenced or unexpected state, all hot paths strictly follow the **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** pattern. Storage state reads and updates precede external interactions whenever feasible.

### Hot-Path Per-Function Review Notes

#### 1. `deposit` & `batch_deposit`
- **Audit Findings**: Previously, `token_client.transfer(...)` was called before calculating state updates (`TotalDeposits`, `TotalShares`, `TotalAssets`, `Shares(user)`, `UserStrategy`).
- **Resolution**: Re-structured so all contract checks, storage reads, share-minting math, and storage writes (`TotalDeposits`, `Shares`, `TotalShares`, `TotalAssets`, `UserStrategy`, `UserSharesIndex`) take place **before** initiating the external USDC token transfer call. No storage reads occur after the cross-contract `transfer`.

#### 2. `withdraw` & `withdraw_all`
- **Audit Findings**: If idle vault balance was lower than requested, `withdraw_amount_from_protocol(...)` called external protocol contracts (Blend/DEX) before validating `Shares(user)`, `TotalShares`, and `TotalAssets`. An unauthorized user or invalid withdrawal could cause unnecessary external protocol interactions before failing.
- **Resolution**: User share balances (`Shares(user)`), `TotalShares`, and `TotalAssets` are now read and validated upfront before any external protocol withdrawal call. If a protocol withdrawal is required, reconciled share burn calculations use the pre-read snapshot totals (`convert_to_shares_internal_ceil_with_totals`), ensuring no storage reads take place after protocol interactions.

#### 3. `rebalance`
- **Audit Findings**: Pre-reads all configuration and timing parameters (`ApprovalTtl`, `BlendPool`, `DexPool`, `MinRebalanceInterval`, `LastRebalanceLedger`) before triggering protocol exit or supply legs.
- **Resolution**: All storage parameters required for authorization and leg setup are read prior to invoking external protocol contracts (`submit_with_allowance`, `add_liquidity`, `remove_liquidity`).

#### 4. `update_total_assets`
- **Audit Findings**: The contract previously read `CurrentProtocol`, `BlendPool`, and `DexPool` keys intermittently between balance queries.
- **Resolution**: All storage keys (`Agent`, `TotalAssets`, `UsdcToken`, `CurrentProtocol`, `BlendPool`, `DexPool`) are read upfront prior to executing cross-contract balance calls (`token_client.balance`, `BlendPoolClient::get_balance`, `DexPoolClient::get_balance`). Following external calls, only the invariant check (`total_available >= new_total`) and storage write (`TotalAssets`) execute.

### Automated Verification
A grep-based CI check script ([`scripts/check-stale-state-audit.sh`](file:///c:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/Open-source/NeuroWealth-Smartcontract/scripts/check-stale-state-audit.sh)) enforces these invariants on every PR.

## Cross-Contract Call Surface & Failure-Mode Analysis (Issue #566)

The `NeuroWealthVault` contract interacts with three categories of external smart contracts: the underlying USDC Token contract (Soroban SEP-41 standard), the Blend Lending Pool contract, and DEX AMM Pool contracts.

### Summary Table of Cross-Contract Calls

| Invocation | Target Contract | Entrypoints | Expected Success Path | Revert Behavior | Partial-Fill Behavior | Vault Accounting Reaction & Test Mapping |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `token_client.transfer` | USDC Token | `deposit`, `batch_deposit`, `withdraw`, `withdraw_all` | Tokens transferred between user and vault contract address; emits `DepositEvent` / `WithdrawEvent`. | Reverts on-chain (insufficient balance/allowance or frozen account). | Binary (all-or-nothing); no partial transfers in SEP-41. | Storage state updates execute **before** `transfer` (CEI pattern). Transaction revert rolls back storage state atomically. Tested in [`test_reentrancy_defense.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_reentrancy_defense.rs) & [`test_stale_state_audit.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_stale_state_audit.rs). |
| `token_client.balance` | USDC Token | `withdraw`, `withdraw_all`, `rebalance`, `update_total_assets`, `get_protocol_balance` | Returns `i128` token balance held at vault contract address. | Reverts only if contract WASM traps or token address invalid. | N/A (read-only query). | Balance queries act as upper-bound solvency checks. Direct token transfers to vault do not alter share exchange rates (storage-based accounting). |
| `BlendPoolClient::submit_with_allowance` | Blend Pool | `supply_to_blend` (called during `rebalance`, `harvest`, `emergency_harvest`) | Approves allowance and supplies USDC to Blend pool; returns amount supplied. | Reverts if pool paused, supply cap reached, or invalid configuration. | Accepts up to max supply limit if configured; returns actual `supplied` amount. | Updates `CurrentProtocol` to `symbol_short!("blend")`. Revert rolls back transaction atomically without changing protocol assignment. Tested in `test_blend_integration.rs`. |
| `BlendPoolClient::withdraw` / `withdraw_amount_from_protocol` | Blend Pool | `withdraw_from_blend` (called during `withdraw`, `withdraw_all`, `rebalance`, `harvest`) | Redeems USDC liquidity from Blend pool back to vault address. | Reverts if pool contract traps or is uninitialized. | If pool utilization is high, returns available liquidity (`withdrawn < requested`). | Reconciliation logic caps withdrawal to available USDC. User receives available funds and retains remaining shares (`convert_to_shares_internal_ceil_with_totals`). Tested in `test_partial_withdrawal` & [`test_strategy_switch_low_liquidity.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_strategy_switch_low_liquidity.rs). |
| `BlendPoolClient::get_balance` | Blend Pool | `get_protocol_balance`, `update_total_assets` | Returns active deployed balance in Blend pool for vault address. | Reverts if pool call traps. | N/A (read-only query). | Solvency check in `update_total_assets`. Reported loss capped at `max_decrease_bps` (default 10%). Tested in [`test_asset_decrease.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_asset_decrease.rs) & [`test_update_total_assets_blend.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_update_total_assets_blend.rs). |
| `DexPoolClient::add_liquidity` | DEX Pool | `supply_to_dex` (called during `rebalance`, `harvest`, `emergency_harvest`) | Approves allowance, adds USDC liquidity to DEX pool, receives LP position tokens. | Reverts if slippage exceeded or pool paused. | Returns actual LP tokens minted based on pool balance ratio. | Updates `CurrentProtocol` to `symbol_short!("dex")`. If liquidity addition fails, strategy-switch fallback resets `CurrentProtocol` to `symbol_short!("none")` (idle) to protect funds.

### Failure-Mode Analysis & Revert Path Mapping

#### 1. Token Transfer Failure Path (`token_client.transfer`)
- **Failure Trigger**: User account has insufficient USDC balance, insufficient token allowance, or account is subject to Stellar clawback/freeze flags.
- **Handling**: The token contract call panics/reverts. Soroban automatically rolls back the entire atomic transaction frame.
- **Verification**: Covered by `test_deposit.rs`, `test_withdraw.rs`, and defense-in-depth reentrancy test [`test_reentrancy_defense.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_reentrancy_defense.rs).

#### 2. Liquidity Crunch / Partial Fill (`withdraw_amount_from_protocol`)
- **Failure Trigger**: External lending pool (Blend) or DEX pool has high utilization or constrained liquidity when a user requests a withdrawal exceeding idle vault USDC.
- **Handling**: `withdraw_amount_from_protocol` redeems all available protocol liquidity (`available_usdc`). If `available_usdc < entitled_amount`, the vault processes a partial withdrawal: returning `available_usdc` and burning only `shares_to_burn = convert_to_shares_internal_ceil_with_totals(available_usdc, total_shares, total_assets)`. The user retains their remaining un-redeemed shares.
- **Verification**: Fully covered in `test_partial_withdrawal` and [`test_strategy_switch_low_liquidity.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_strategy_switch_low_liquidity.rs).

#### 3. Low-Liquidity Strategy Switch Failure (`rebalance`)
- **Failure Trigger**: When `rebalance()` attempts to switch strategies (e.g. from idle to DEX pool) and the target DEX pool lacks sufficient liquidity for the swap.
- **Handling**: `rebalance()` catches low-liquidity failures and defaults `CurrentProtocol` back to `symbol_short!("none")` (idle USDC), ensuring vault funds remain safe and un-locked.
- **Verification**: Covered by [`test_strategy_switch_low_liquidity.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_strategy_switch_low_liquidity.rs).

#### 4. Malicious Loss Reporting (`update_total_assets`)
- **Failure Trigger**: Compromised or malfunctioning AI Agent reports an artificially inflated asset balance or an un-authorized loss.
- **Handling**:
  - *Inflation*: Blocked by solvency verification (`total_available >= new_total`) where `total_available` is the sum of idle USDC balance and verified protocol balances.

## New Features (Issues #635, #636, #637)

### Emergency Withdrawal (#635)

**Purpose**: Allows users to withdraw funds even when the vault is paused, providing a safety mechanism during extended pauses or governance disputes.

**Key Features**:
- Works when vault is paused (unlike regular withdrawals)
- Requires user authentication (only their own funds)
- Deducts from idle balance first, then from protocol if needed
- Emits `EmergencyWithdrawalEvent` for audit trail
- Follows same rounding rules as regular withdrawals

**Storage**: No new storage keys (uses existing pause state)

**Events**: `EmergencyWithdrawalEvent` (topic `"em_wd"`)

**Security Considerations**:
- Only available when vault is paused
- Users can only withdraw their own funds
- Does not affect rebalance or admin operations
- Maintains same rounding and accounting rules as regular withdrawals

### Share Locking for Boosted APY (#636)

**Purpose**: Allows users to voluntarily lock shares for configurable periods in exchange for boosted APY, similar to ve-tokenomics patterns.

**Key Features**:
- Three lock duration tiers: 30 days (1.1x), 90 days (1.25x), 180 days (1.5x)
- Locked shares cannot be withdrawn until lock period expires
- Withdraw functions respect lock state (only unlocked shares can be withdrawn)
- Boost multiplier affects share price calculation
- Users can unlock shares after expiry

**Storage**:
- `LockedShares(Address)`: Number of shares locked by user
- `LockExpiry(Address)`: Ledger when locked shares can be unlocked

**Events**:
- `SharesLockedEvent` (topic `"lock"`)
- `SharesUnlockedEvent` (topic `"unlock"`)

**Security Considerations**:
- Lock enforced at contract level, not just UI
- Withdraw functions check lock state before processing
- Early withdrawal attempts fail with proper error codes
- Lock expiry checked at ledger level (not time-based)

### Vault Migration (#637)

**Purpose**: Enables trustless user migration from old vault to new vault during contract upgrades, preserving share value through exchange rate conversion.

**Key Features**:
- Owner sets migration target address
- Users can migrate shares independently
- Exchange rate preserved through conversion calculation
- Migration can be paused independently of main vault pause
- Comprehensive event logging for audit trails

**Storage**:
- `MigrationTarget`: Address of new vault contract
- `MigrationPaused`: Independent pause state for migration

**Events**:
- `SharesMigratedEvent` (topic `"migrate"`)
- `MigrationTargetUpdatedEvent` (topic `"mig_tgt"`)
- `MigrationPausedEvent` (topic `"mig_pse"`)

**Security Considerations**:
- Migration target must be owner-set (prevents malicious contracts)
- Migration can be paused independently for safety
- Exchange rate calculated at migration time to preserve value
- User authentication required for migration
- Full event logging enables audit trails

**Integration with Traditional Upgrades**:
- Can complement storage migrations or replace them
- Users maintain control over their funds during upgrades
- Provides flexibility for different upgrade scenarios
- Old vault remains operational as fallback
  - *Loss*: Decreases require owner co-signatures (`require_is_owner`) and are hard-capped at `max_decrease_bps` (minimum cap floor 100 bps / 1%, default 10%).
- **Verification**: Covered by [`test_asset_decrease.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_asset_decrease.rs) and [`test_update_total_assets_blend.rs`](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_update_total_assets_blend.rs).

## Performance Fee Structure

The protocol charges a configurable performance fee on earned yield to fund maintenance, monitoring infrastructure, and gas reimbursements.

- **Data Key**: `DataKey::PerformanceFeeBps`
- **Maximum Cap**: 1,000 basis points (10.00%) strictly enforced at the smart contract level (`FeeExceedsMaximum` error on violations)
- **Settlement**: Deducted from harvested yield during auto-compounding cycles and directed to the configured Treasury address
- **Events**: Emits `PerformanceFeeEvent { treasury, yield_gross, fee_amount, bps }`

## On-chain rate limiting

The vault applies fixed-window rate limits in the contract rather than relying on
an RPC gateway or the AI agent. The current ledger sequence is the only clock:
a bucket starts at the ledger of its first accepted call and resets when
`current_ledger - window_start >= window_ledgers`. A reset overwrites the same
bucket; no call history is retained.

### Configuration and categories

The owner configures a category with:

```text
set_rate_limit(category, max_calls, window_ledgers)
```

`max_calls == 0` disables a category. Enabled categories require a non-zero
window. Supported category symbols are:

| Category | Scope | Protected entrypoints | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | Per user | `deposit`, and the deposit leg of `batch_deposit` | 100 / 720 ledgers |
| `withdraw` | Per user | `withdraw`, `withdraw_all` | 100 / 720 ledgers |
| `rebalance` | Global | `rebalance`, `harvest`, `emergency_harvest` | 100 / 720 ledgers |
| `touch_ttl` | Per user | `touch_user_ttl` | 5 / 1 ledger |
| `preview` | Global | all three `preview_*` and both `convert_to_*` calls | 1,000 / 1 ledger |
| `batch_dep` | Per user | `batch_deposit` | 100 / 720 ledgers |

The defaults are deliberately compatible with normal client composition while
putting a finite ceiling on high-frequency transactions. Production operators
should tighten them for the vault's expected workload. The rebalance bucket is
additional to, and does not replace, `MinRebalanceInterval` and
`LastRebalanceLedger`.

`get_rate_limit`/`get_rate_limit_config` expose the configured policy;
`get_global_rate_limit_state` and `get_user_rate_limit_state` expose the current
bucket for monitoring. Configuration changes emit
`RateLimitConfigUpdatedEvent` (`rate_cfg`). The owner can also set the maximum
number of entries in `batch_deposit` with `set_max_batch_size` (default `50`,
`0` means unlimited), which emits `BatchSizeLimitUpdatedEvent` (`batch_lim`).

### Storage layout

Rate-limit policies and usage are kept in **instance storage**:

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RateLimitConfig(Symbol)` | `RateLimitConfig` | Owner policy (`max_calls`, `window_ledgers`) |
| `RateLimitGlobalState(Symbol)` | `RateLimitState` | Global category window and accepted-call count |
| `RateLimitUserState(Address, Symbol)` | `RateLimitState` | Per-user category window and accepted-call count |
| `MaxBatchSize` | `u32` | Batch entry ceiling |

The new `DataKey` variants are appended to preserve all existing serialized key
discriminants across upgrades. User buckets use instance storage intentionally:
unlike `Shares(user)`, they must not expire and silently reset through persistent
storage TTL. A caller's first accepted operation creates one bounded bucket per
category; later calls update that key in place. This trades a small amount of
instance storage growth for a reliable anti-bypass guarantee. Sybil addresses
can still create distinct per-user buckets, so transaction fees, TVL caps, and
authentication remain required complementary controls.

### Enforcement order and gas behavior

Each guard runs after initialization, authentication, pause, and ordinary input
validation, but before token or protocol calls. It performs one policy read and
one bucket read, then one bucket write only when the operation is accepted. A
disabled category returns before reading the bucket. `batch_deposit` counts once
in both the regular deposit bucket and its batch bucket, preventing batching
from bypassing the single-deposit frequency policy; its entry count is checked
before the transfer loop. All preview/conversion entrypoints share one global
bucket so callers cannot bypass the computational bound by alternating method
names.

When a bucket is exhausted, the contract raises `VaultError::RateLimitExceeded`
and publishes `RateLimitExceededEvent` (`rate_hit`) with the category, scope,
ledger, window, configured maximum, and observed count. The event is published
on the rejection path so monitoring can correlate attempted over-limit calls with
their category and window. The rejection still returns a contract error; indexers
should also monitor failed transaction result codes because event visibility for
reverted transactions depends on the ledger and RPC surface.
